<p>Welcome to Getting started! If you are a complete beginner (i.e.,
you’ve not installed a code editor or written any code yet), then this
is the place to be. The Getting started modules take you through
installing the software you need, familiarity with your development
environment, taking your first stab at building a simple website, and
understanding some of the essential concepts surrounding web
development.</p>

Getting started modules Next In the Environment setup module, we show
you what tools you need to do simple web development and how to install
them properly and help you understand important aspects of your
environment such as file systems and the command line.</p>
<p>In this article Prerequisites Tutorials Prerequisites This module
assumes no prior technical knowledge, beyond basic computer usage. You
should be able to:</p>
<p>Sign into your computer and connect it to the internet. Use basic
system controls such as keyboard and mouse (or other pointing devices).
Install applications. If you need to refresh yourself on such basics,
we’d recommend the following resources depending on what operating
system you are using:</p>
<p>Windows help and learning, Microsoft (2024) macOS User Guide, Apple
(2024) Official Ubuntu documentation, ubuntu.com (2024) Tutorials
Installing software In this article, we show you what tools you need to
do simple web development and how to install them properly. We’ll set
you up with the bare minimum of tools for now, including a text editor
and some modern web browsers.</p>
<h2 id="browsing-the-web">Browsing the web</h2>
<p>This article goes a little deeper into using browsers, looking at how
a web browser works, the difference between some of the common items
you’ll interact with, and how to search for information.</p>
<p>Code editors In this article we look at code editors in more detail,
giving you an idea of what they can do for you.</p>
<p>Dealing with files This article discusses some issues you should be
aware of with file systems so you can set up a sensible file structure
for your website.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-crash-course">Command line crash course</h2>
<p>This article provides an introduction to the terminal, the essential
commands you’ll need to enter into it, how to chain commands together,
and how to add your own command line interface (CLI) tools. Installing
basic software Overview: Environment Setup Next In this article, we
discuss what software you need to do simple web development and what you
need to install now, including a code editor and some modern web
browsers.</p>
<p>Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with your computer operating system
(OS). Learning outcomes:<br />
Understand what software you need to get started. Install a code editor,
some modern browsers, and a local testing server. Explore options for
other common types of apps. In this article - Code editors - Modern web
browsers - Local web servers - Graphics editors - Version control tools
- Site deployment apps - Code editors A decent code editor is one of the
most important things for any developer to have available on their
machine. As well as being the place where you write your code, code
editors have a whole host of other functionality available. We have
dedicated an entire article to code editors later on in the series.</p>
<p>For now, we would recommend that you install Visual Studio Code, as
it is available across different platforms, has a great feature set and
support, and is the editor we mostly use. You should install this now to
follow along with the rest of this article.</p>
<h2 id="modern-web-browsers">Modern web browsers</h2>
<p>Having modern web browsers available to you is essential for web
development so that you can test your websites or apps on the browsers
your visitors use to access them. You also need to keep your web
browsers up-to-date so that they support the latest web technologies and
have the latest security fixes applied.</p>
<p>The most common browsers you’ll come across are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="desktop-browsers">Desktop browsers:</h3>
<p>Chromium: Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi.
Gecko: Mozilla Firefox. WebKit: Apple Safari. Mobile/alternative device
browsers: Chromium (Android): Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Microsoft
Edge, Samsung Internet, Vivaldi. Gecko (Android): Mozilla Firefox.
WebKit (iOS): Apple Safari</p>
<h1 id="code-blokovi">code blokovi</h1>
<p>const button = document.querySelector(“button”);</p>
<p>button.addEventListener(“click”, () =&gt; { alert(“Kliknuo si
gumb!”); });</p>
<p>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</p>
<p>const squared = numbers.map(n =&gt; n * n); console.log(squared);</p>
